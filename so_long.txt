Map parsing correctly handles:
File extension validation (.ber)
Duplicate player/exit detection
Missing required elements (P, E, C)
Invalid characters

Map validation implements:
Wall enclosure checking
Flood fill algorithm for valid path detection
Collectible counting

Error handling properly outputs "Error\n" for invalid maps

The tester is designed to:
Test error maps (which should exit immediately with errors) ✅
Test memory leaks on error cases ✅

In error_handler.c:
Your error output includes extra message after "Error\n", which might not match expected format for some testers
Subject typically requires only "Error\n" without additional details

In map_parser.c:
get_next_line has a fixed 1000-byte buffer - could overflow on very long lines
No check for empty lines in the middle of maps

In game_input.c:
Move counter prints to stdout - this is correct per requirements ✅

🎯 Test Results:
Test Type	Result
Bad extension (.txt)	✅ Pass - Returns Error
Duplicate exit	✅ Pass - Returns Error
No exit	✅ Pass - Returns Error
Compilation	✅ Pass
Memory leaks (errors)	✅ Pass
Valid maps	⏸️ Hangs (expected - opens game window)

📋 Recommendations:
For the tester: The tester timeout is expected. You'll need to manually test valid maps by running them directly
Test manually with: ./so_long maps_valid/ok.ber and verify:
Game window opens
Player can move with WASD/arrows
Collectibles disappear when collected
Exit works after collecting all items
ESC closes the game
Move counter displays in terminal

Missing files check: Do you have sprite/texture files? The code references load_sprites() but I don't see a textures directory

Excellent! Your sprites are programmatically generated - very creative sea-themed graphics! Now let me check the remaining files and test the game:

Now let me test your program with some error cases to verify the exact output format:

Invalid map file
Good! Now let me check what the tester expects vs what you're outputting. Let me look at the tester more carefully:
Read Tester_so_long.sh (lines 51-100)
Perfect! I can see the tester:
Expects "Error" on line 1 (which you do ✅)
Expects an explicit error message on line 2 (which you provide ✅)
For valid maps, it launches the program, waits 0.35s, checks if it's still running, then kills it
Your code is actually correct! The issue is that your error messages are going to stderr properly. Let me run a more comprehensive test manually:

1. Code Organization (Outstanding)
Your code is very well structured:
main.c - Clean entry point with extension validation
map_parser.c - Robust map reading with get_next_line
map_validator.c - Wall checking + flood fill path validation
game_init.c - Proper initialization flow
game_input.c - Clean keyboard handling (WASD + Arrows + ESC)
game_logic.c - Win condition checking
game_render.c - Camera system for large maps + HUD
sprite_loader.c - Impressive programmatic sprite generation!
animation.c - 4-frame animation system
cleanup.c - Proper memory management
error_handler.c - Centralized error output

2. Features Implemented ✅
Core Requirements:
✅ Map parsing from .ber files
✅ File extension validation
✅ Rectangular map validation
✅ Wall enclosure checking
✅ Player (P), Exit (E), Collectible (C) detection
✅ Duplicate P/E detection
✅ Minimum collectible (≥1) validation
✅ Flood fill path validation (excellent!)
✅ Movement counter in terminal
✅ Collectible counting
✅ Win condition (all collectibles + reach exit)
✅ ESC key exits program
✅ Window close button exits program
✅ Error output: "Error\n" format

Bonus Features:
✅ Animated sprites (4-frame dolphin player + fish collectibles)
✅ Camera system for large maps (supports maps > window size)
✅ On-screen HUD (moves, collectibles, win message)
✅ Beautiful sea theme with programmatically generated graphics:

🧪 Test Results
Error Handling Tests ✅
Test Case	Expected	Actual	Status
No arguments	Error	Error + usage message	✅ Pass
Bad extension (.txt)	Error	Error + extension message	✅ Pass
Bad extension (.bber)	Error	Error + extension message	✅ Pass
Nonexistent file	Error	Error + invalid map	✅ Pass
Duplicate player	Error	Error + invalid map	✅ Pass
Duplicate exit	Error	Error + invalid map	✅ Pass
No exit	Error	Error + invalid map	✅ Pass
No player	Error	Error + invalid map	✅ Pass
No collectibles	Error	Error + invalid map	✅ Pass
Wrong characters	Error	Error + invalid map	✅ Pass
Non-rectangular	Error	Error + invalid map	✅ Pass
No walls (not enclosed)	Error	Error + validation failed	✅ Pass
No valid path	Error	Error + validation failed	✅ Pass

Tester Compatibility
The So_long-Tester from gemartin99 will:
✅ Pass all error map tests - Your program correctly outputs "Error\n" + message
✅ Pass memory leak tests (uses leaks command on macOS)
⏸️ Hang on valid map tests - This is expected behavior! Valid maps open a window and wait for user input (mlx_loop), which is correct per the subject.
The tester launches valid maps in background for 0.35s to verify they don't crash, then kills them. This may or may not work depending on display environment.

🎨 Code Quality Highlights
Excellent Implementations:
Flood Fill Algorithm (map_validator.c:65-101)
// Creates grid copy, flood fills from player position,
// verifies all collectibles and exit are reachable
This is the correct and recommended approach for path validation!

Animated Sprites (sprite_loader.c)
Programmatically generates 64x64 pixel sprites
4-frame swimming animations with sine wave motion
No external texture files needed
Memory efficient

Camera System (game_render.c:48-88)
Centers camera on player
Handles maps larger than window
Smooth scrolling boundaries

Clean Memory Management (cleanup.c)
Destroys all 4 animation frames for player/collectibles
Frees map grid properly
Destroys window and images

⚠️ Minor Issues & Suggestions
1. get_next_line Buffer Size (map_parser.c:11)
buffer = malloc(1000);  // Fixed size, could overflow on very long lines
Risk: Low (maps are typically small)
Suggestion: Add check or use dynamic reallocation

2. Empty Map File (map_parser.c:113)
if (game->map.height <= 0)
    return (0);
Issue: Empty files or files with only newlines might not be caught properly
Status: Probably fine, but could add explicit check

3. Error Message Verbosity (error_handler.c:3-11)
Your error messages include details like:
"Usage: ./so_long map_file.ber"
"Map file must have .ber extension"
"Invalid map file"
Subject requirement: Only "Error\n" is mandatory
Your implementation: Better UX with descriptive messages ✅
Tester compatibility: ✅ Works (tester checks for "Error" on line 1, accepts any message on line 2)

🎯 Recommendations
For Manual Testing (Required)
Since the tester hangs on valid maps (expected), you must manually test gameplay:
# Test with different map sizes
./so_long maps/simple.ber
./so_long maps/complex.ber
./so_long maps_valid/ok.ber

# Verify:
# - Window opens successfully
# - Animated dolphin player visible
# - WASD/Arrow keys move player
# - Move counter prints to terminal on each move
# - Collectible (fish) count updates when collected
# - Can't move through walls
# - Can't exit until all collectibles gathered
# - ESC key closes game cleanly
# - Window close button works
# ```

```

## 🕹️ Game Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `W` or `↑` | Move Up |
| `A` or `←` | Move Left |
| `S` or `↓` | Move Down |
| `D` or `→` | Move Right |
| `ESC` | Exit Game |

**Objective:**
1. Control the 🐬 dolphin player
2. Collect all 🐟 fish (collectibles)
3. Reach the 🌱 seaweed exit portal
4. Complete in minimum moves!

## 🗺️ Map Format

Maps are `.ber` files with the following characters:

| Character | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `1` | Wall (impassable) |
| `0` | Empty space (water) |
| `C` | Collectible (fish) |
| `E` | Exit (portal) |
| `P` | Player start position (dolphin) |

### Map Requirements
- Must be rectangular
- Must be surrounded by walls (`1`)
- Must contain exactly 1 player (`P`)
- Must contain exactly 1 exit (`E`)
- Must contain at least 1 collectible (`C`)
- Must have a valid path from player to all collectibles and exit
- Minimum size: 3x3

### Example Map
```
1111111
1E0C0P1
1111111
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Automated Tests
```bash
# Run the comprehensive test script
./test_maps.sh
```

# The tester is included in the project
bash Tester_so_long.sh
```

**Note:** The tester may hang on valid maps because they open a window and wait for user input (expected behavior). Error map tests will pass successfully.
