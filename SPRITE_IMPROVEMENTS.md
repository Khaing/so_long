## 🎨 Technical Improvements

### New Drawing Functions:

#### `draw_ellipse()` - Ellipse Drawing
```c
// Draws elliptical shapes for realistic body forms
// Parameters: center_x, center_y, radius_x, radius_y
```

#### `put_pixel()` - Safe Pixel Drawing
```c
// Draws single pixel with boundary checking
// Prevents drawing outside the 64x64 tile
```

### Benefits:
- ✅ **More realistic** - Actual dolphin and fish shapes
- ✅ **Better details** - Fins, tails, eyes
- ✅ **Still norm-compliant** - All functions ≤ 25 lines
- ✅ **Smooth curves** - Ellipse algorithm
- ✅ **Better visibility** - Clear distinct shapes

---

## 📊 Comparison

### Before (Simple):
- Circle dolphin

- Rectangle gate
- Solid colors

### After (Beautiful):
- 🐬 **Elliptical dolphin** with fin and tail
- 🐟 **Oval fish** with fins
- 🟢 **Detailed gate** with 3D bars
- 🌊 **Textured ocean** with waves

## 🚀 Performance

- **Fast rendering** - Optimized ellipse algorithm
- **No slowdown** - Efficient pixel operations
- **Smooth gameplay** - No lag

## 🎨 Color Psychology

### Why These Colors?
- **Blue ocean** - Calming, immersive
- **Gold fish** - Valuable, attracts attention
- **Green gate** - Goal, safety, exit
- **Blue dolphin** - Friendly, recognizable
- **Red coral** - Danger, obstacle

---

## 🎯 Visual Clarity

Each sprite is now **instantly recognizable**:
- See the **dolphin shape** immediately
- **Fish looks like a fish** - not just a circle
- **Gate clearly shows bars** - obvious exit
- **Coral has texture** - clear obstacle

---

## 🎉 Enjoy!

Your game now has:
- ✨ **Realistic dolphin** with anatomically correct shape
- ✨ **Proper fish** with body, tail, and fins
- ✨ **Professional-looking gate** with 3D effect
- ✨ **Textured backgrounds** for atmosphere
- ✨ **All while being 42 Norm compliant!**

Run and see the difference:
```bash
./so_long maps/simple.ber
```

**The sprites now actually look like what they represent!** 🐬🐟🌊
